# 6502-Audio
A collection of schematics and programs for my 6502-based midi audio synth/development platform. Based off of Ben Eater's design.

The 6502 folder contains a kicad schematic for the full computer, along with part lists.

Old test .s files may not be valid on the most recent hardware build.

commands.txt contains the proper vasm commands for compiling assembly files to ROM files for the 6502 microprocessor. Vasm can be downloaded <a href="http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/">here</a>
